# Logistic Regression vs. Decision Tree for Churn Analysis 

This repository contains comprehensive files for retrieving data from a Kaggle Dataset to be used in a logistic regression model and a decision tree model to determine customer churn rates. The analysis and appropriate visuals will be displayed in the visuals folder.

### Dataset Information:
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
